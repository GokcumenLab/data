# data
Additional datasets and relevant code bits from papers

Veilleux et al. 2021: The code (Lof.R) and input files for analysis and reproducing some of the figures in the paper. Some customization (e.g., change of file input file names, etc.) may be necessary to fully replicate the graphs and analysis. In addition, we provide QC data that helped us filter out samples and genes from analysis (QC_data.xlsx) Please contact Omer Gokcumen (gokcumen@gmail.com) or Petar Pajic (petarpaj@buffalo.edu) if you have any questions. Please note that some of the annotations are done after generation of the figures using BioRender.
